# FusionGuard Analytics

FusionGuard Analytics demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for credit card fraud detection and customer churn risk modelling, showcasing modern data science and MLOps practices across the full lifecycle.

Key components:

- Data engineering pipelines using Spark-ready scripts (`src/data`)
- Fraud detection models (XGBoost, autoencoder) and churn prediction models (`src/models`)
- MLOps scaffolding (`mlops`) with experiment tracking and deployment hooks
- Notebooks for exploratory analysis (`notebooks/eda`)
- Documentation (`docs`) covering data sources, responsible AI, and executive summaries

Setup and usage guides will be added as the environment is built out.
